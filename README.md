### Fresh Squeak Image

Loads current sources, a trunk image and sources from [Squeak.org/trunk](ftp://ftp.squeak.org/trunk). Runs them with a specified Squeak VM to update the image and to load a Metacello configuration.

From [Orca](https://github.com/orcaproject/orca), but only the build script
and adapted to load only a specific Metacello configuration.
